Java does not have an exact equivalent to the `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` method in C#. However, there are several ways to start a process in Java, depending on your specific needs. Here are a few options:

1. `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`: This method allows you to execute a command or program and returns a `Process` object that represents the running process. You can use this method to start a new process by specifying the name of the executable file or the command to run, along with any arguments or options.
2. `ProcessBuilder`: This class provides a more flexible way to create and manage processes in Java. It allows you to specify various options for the process, such as the working directory, environment variables, and input/output streams. You can use the `start()` method of the `ProcessBuilder` class to start the process.
3. `java.lang.Process`: This class represents a process that is running in the Java virtual machine (JVM). It provides methods for interacting with the process, such as getting its exit value or destroying it. You can use this class to start a new process by calling the `start()` method and passing in the name of the executable file or the command to run.

Here is an example of how you might use each of these methods to start a new process in Java:
```
// Using Runtime.getRuntime().exec()
Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("myprogram");

// Using ProcessBuilder
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("myprogram", "arg1", "arg2");
pb.directory(new File("path/to/working/dir"));
Process p = pb.start();

// Using java.lang.Process
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myprogram").start();
```
