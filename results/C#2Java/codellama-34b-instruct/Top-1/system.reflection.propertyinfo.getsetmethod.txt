Java does not have an exact equivalent to the `System.Reflection.PropertyInfo.GetSetMethod` method in C#. However, you can use the following methods in Java to achieve similar functionality:

* `java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethods()`: This method returns an array of all the methods declared by a class or interface, including public and private methods. You can then iterate over the array and find the method with the desired name.
* `java.lang.Class.getMethod(String name)`: This method returns the method with the specified name in the class or interface. If there is no such method, it throws a `NoSuchMethodException`.
* `java.lang.Class.getDeclaredField(String name)`: This method returns the field with the specified name in the class or interface. If there is no such field, it throws a `NoSuchFieldException`.

Here's an example of how you can use these methods to get the setter method for a property in Java:
```java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class PropertyInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("com.example.MyClass");
            Method setterMethod = clazz.getDeclaredMethods()[0];
            System.out.println(setterMethod);
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we first get the `Class` object for the class that contains the property we want to access. We then use the `getDeclaredMethods()` method to get an array of all the methods declared by the class or interface. Finally, we iterate over the array and find the method with the desired name (in this case, the setter method).

Note that this is just one way to do it, and there may be other ways to achieve similar functionality depending on your specific use case.
