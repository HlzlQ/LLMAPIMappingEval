Java does not have a direct equivalent to the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex` class in C#. However, Java has a built-in regular expression engine that can be used to perform similar operations. The most likely candidate for the full name of the API is:

`java.util.regex.Pattern`

This class provides methods for compiling and matching regular expressions, as well as methods for replacing and splitting strings based on regular expressions. It is the Java equivalent of the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex` class in C#.
