Java does not have an exact equivalent to the `System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess()` method in C#. However, you can use the following methods to achieve similar functionality in Java:

1. `java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName()`: This method returns a string that represents the name of the current process. The name is typically the name of the main class or the name specified in the manifest file, if present.
2. `java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getPid()`: This method returns the process ID (PID) of the current process. You can use this PID to identify the process and perform other operations on it.
3. `java.lang.ProcessHandle.current()`: This method returns a `ProcessHandle` object that represents the current process. You can use this object to get information about the process, such as its name, PID, and command line arguments.

Note that these methods are not exact equivalents of the C# API, but they provide similar functionality in Java.
