  The C# API `system.char.isdigit` can be mapped to the following Java APIs:

* `Character.isDigit(int codePoint)`
* `Character.isDigit(char ch)`

Both of these methods return a boolean value indicating whether the specified character is a digit or not. The main difference between them is that the first method takes an integer code point as an argument, while the second method takes a char value.
