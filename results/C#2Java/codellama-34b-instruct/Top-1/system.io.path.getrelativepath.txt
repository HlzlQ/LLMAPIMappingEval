Java does not have a direct equivalent to the `System.IO.Path.GetRelativePath` method in C#. However, you can use the `java.nio.file.Path` class to achieve similar functionality.

Here is an example of how you can use the `java.nio.file.Path` class to get a relative path between two paths:
```
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class RelativePathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Path basePath = Paths.get("/path/to/base");
        Path relativePath = Paths.get("relative/path");
        
        // Get the relative path between the two paths
        Path resolvedPath = basePath.resolve(relativePath);
        
        System.out.println(resolvedPath);
    }
}
```
This will output the relative path between the two paths, which in this case is `relative/path`.
