  Here are ten possible Java APIs that correspond to the given C# API:

1. `java.time.ZoneId` - This class represents a time zone ID, which can be used to convert between local time and UTC.
2. `java.time.ZonedDateTime` - This class represents a date and time with a time zone, and it can be used to perform time zone conversions.
3. `java.time.LocalTime` - This class represents a time without a time zone, and it can be used to convert between local time and UTC.
4. `java.time.OffsetDateTime` - This class represents a date and time with an offset from UTC, and it can be used to perform time zone conversions.
5. `java.time.Instant` - This class represents a moment in time, and it can be used to convert between local time and UTC.
6. `java.time.ZoneOffset` - This class represents the offset from UTC for a given time zone, and it can be used to perform time zone conversions.
7. `java.time.ZonedTime` - This class represents a time with a time zone, and it can be used to perform time zone conversions.
8. `java.time.LocalDateTime` - This class represents a date and time without a time zone, and it can be used to convert between local time and UTC.
9. `java.time.OffsetTime` - This class represents a time with an offset from UTC, and it can be used to perform time zone conversions.
10. `java.time.DateTimeFormatter` - This class is used to format and parse dates and times in various formats, including ISO 8601.

It's worth noting that the Java API provides more functionality than the C# API, so it may be necessary to use multiple APIs together to achieve the desired result.
