  Here are five possible Java APIs that correspond to the C# `System.Net.Dns.GetHostByName` method:

1. `java.net.InetAddress.getByName`: This method returns an InetAddress object for a given hostname or IP address string. It is similar to the C# `GetHostByName` method in that it allows you to look up the IP address of a host by its name.
2. `java.net.InetAddress.getAllByName`: This method returns an array of InetAddress objects for a given hostname or IP address string. It is similar to the C# `GetHostByName` method in that it allows you to look up all the IP addresses associated with a host by its name.
3. `java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost`: This method returns an InetAddress object for the local host. It is similar to the C# `GetHostByName` method in that it allows you to look up the IP address of the local host.
4. `java.net.NetworkInterface.getByName`: This method returns a NetworkInterface object for a given network interface name. It is similar to the C# `GetHostByName` method in that it allows you to look up information about a specific network interface by its name.
5. `java.net.NetworkInterface.getAllByName`: This method returns an array of NetworkInterface objects for a given network interface name. It is similar to the C# `GetHostByName` method in that it allows you to look up all the network interfaces associated with a host by its name.

It's worth noting that while these Java APIs have similarities to the C# `System.Net.Dns.GetHostByName` method, they may not be exact equivalents due to differences in the underlying networking implementations of the two languages.
