  Sure! Here are the top 5 Java APIs that I believe are similar to the C# API `system.collections.generic.sortedlist.get`:

1. `java.util.SortedMap` - This interface extends the `Map` interface and provides a sorted map implementation. It has a `get()` method that returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if no such mapping exists.
2. `java.util.TreeMap` - This class implements the `SortedMap` interface and provides a sorted map implementation based on a tree structure. It also has a `get()` method that returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if no such mapping exists.
3. `java.util.NavigableMap` - This interface extends the `SortedMap` interface and provides additional methods for navigating the map. It also has a `get()` method that returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if no such mapping exists.
4. `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap` - This class implements the `NavigableMap` interface and provides a concurrent skip list map implementation. It also has a `get()` method that returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if no such mapping exists.
5. `java.util.Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(SortedMap<K,V>)` - This method returns a synchronized (thread-safe) sorted map backed by the specified sorted map. It also has a `get()` method that returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if no such mapping exists.

Note that these are just some of the APIs that I believe are similar to the C# API `system.collections.generic.sortedlist.get`. There may be other APIs available in Java that provide similar functionality.
