  Sure! Here are the top 5 APIs in Java that match the functionality of the C# `System.Math.Ceiling` API:

1. `java.lang.Math.ceil(double a)` - This method returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
2. `java.lang.Math.ceiling(float a)` - This method returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) float value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
3. `java.lang.Math.ceil(int a)` - This method returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) int value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
4. `java.lang.Math.ceiling(long a)` - This method returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) long value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
5. `java.lang.Math.ceil(double a, int precision)` - This method returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the argument and has a precision of at least `precision`.

Note that these APIs are not exact matches for the C# `System.Math.Ceiling` API, but they provide similar functionality and can be used in similar contexts.
