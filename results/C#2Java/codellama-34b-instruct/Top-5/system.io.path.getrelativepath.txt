  Here are five possible Java APIs that correspond to the C# `System.IO.Path.GetRelativePath` method:

1. `java.nio.file.Paths.getRelativePath()`: This method returns a relative path between two paths.
2. `java.nio.file.Path.relativize()`: This method returns the relative path from one path to another.
3. `java.io.File.getRelativePath()`: This method returns the relative path of a file or directory based on the current working directory.
4. `org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getRelativePath()`: This method returns the relative path between two files or directories.
5. `com.google.common.io.Files.getRelativePath()`: This method returns the relative path between two files or directories.

It's worth noting that the Java APIs listed above may have slightly different syntax and behavior compared to the C# API, but they all serve a similar purpose of returning a relative path between two paths.
