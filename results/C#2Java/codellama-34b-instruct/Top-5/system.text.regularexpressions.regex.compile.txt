  Here are five possible Java APIs that correspond to the C# API `system.text.regularexpressions.regex.compile`:

1. `java.util.regex.Pattern` - This class provides methods for compiling and manipulating regular expressions in Java. It has a method called `compile()` that is similar to the C# `Regex.Compile()` method.
2. `java.util.regex.Matcher` - This class provides methods for matching regular expressions against input strings. It has a method called `match()` that can be used to match a regular expression against an input string, and it also has a method called `find()` that can be used to find all occurrences of the regular expression in the input string.
3. `java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException` - This class represents an exception that is thrown when there is a syntax error in a regular expression pattern. It has a constructor that takes a message and a cause, which can be used to create an instance of this class with a custom message and cause.
4. `java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException` - This class represents an exception that is thrown when there is a syntax error in a regular expression pattern. It has a constructor that takes a message and a cause, which can be used to create an instance of this class with a custom message and cause.
5. `java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException` - This class represents an exception that is thrown when there is a syntax error in a regular expression pattern. It has a constructor that takes a message and a cause, which can be used to create an instance of this class with a custom message and cause.

It's worth noting that the Java API for regular expressions is slightly different from the C# API, so you may need to make some adjustments to your code in order to use it effectively. However, the `java.util.regex` package provides many of the same features as the C# `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespace, and can be used to perform a wide range of regular expression operations in Java.
