Here are five possible Java APIs that correspond to the C# `System.Drawing.Graphics` class:

1. `java.awt.Graphics2D`: This is a 2D graphics class that provides methods for drawing shapes, text, and images on a component or canvas. It has many of the same methods as the C# `Graphics` class, such as `drawLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawString()`.
2. `java.awt.Graphics`: This is a 2D graphics class that provides methods for drawing shapes, text, and images on a component or canvas. It has many of the same methods as the C# `Graphics` class, such as `drawLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawString()`.
3. `javafx.scene.canvas.GraphicsContext`: This is a 2D graphics context that provides methods for drawing shapes, text, and images on a canvas. It has many of the same methods as the C# `Graphics` class, such as `strokeLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawText()`.
4. `javafx.scene.paint.Paint`: This is an abstract class that provides methods for painting shapes, text, and images on a canvas. It has many of the same methods as the C# `Graphics` class, such as `strokeLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawText()`.
5. `javafx.scene.shape.Shape`: This is an abstract class that provides methods for drawing shapes on a canvas. It has many of the same methods as the C# `Graphics` class, such as `strokeLine()`, `fillRect()`, and `drawArc()`.
