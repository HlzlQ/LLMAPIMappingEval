  Here are five possible C# APIs that correspond to the Java API `java.security.messagedigest.reset`:

1. `System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm.Initialize()`: This method initializes a hash algorithm object for use in computing a message digest.
2. `System.Security.Cryptography.MD5.Reset()`: This method resets the MD5 hash algorithm to its initial state, allowing it to be reused for multiple hashing operations.
3. `System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1.Reset()`: This method resets the SHA-1 hash algorithm to its initial state, allowing it to be reused for multiple hashing operations.
4. `System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256.Reset()`: This method resets the SHA-256 hash algorithm to its initial state, allowing it to be reused for multiple hashing operations.
5. `System.Security.Cryptography.SHA384.Reset()`: This method resets the SHA-384 hash algorithm to its initial state, allowing it to be reused for multiple hashing operations.
