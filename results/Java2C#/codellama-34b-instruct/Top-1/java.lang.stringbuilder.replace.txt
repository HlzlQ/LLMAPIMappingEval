C# does not have a direct equivalent to the Java StringBuilder class. However, you can use the System.Text.StringBuilder class in C# to perform similar operations as the Java StringBuilder class.

Here is the mapping of some common methods between Java StringBuilder and C# System.Text.StringBuilder:

| Java StringBuilder | C# System.Text.StringBuilder |
| --- | --- |
| append() | Append() |
| delete() | Remove() |
| insert() | Insert() |
| replace() | Replace() |
| reverse() | Reverse() |
| toString() | ToString() |

Note that the C# System.Text.StringBuilder class also has additional methods not found in the Java StringBuilder class, such as AppendFormat(), CopyTo(), and Remove().
