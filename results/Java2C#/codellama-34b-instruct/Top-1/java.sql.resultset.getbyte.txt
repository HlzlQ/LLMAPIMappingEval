C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.sql.ResultSet` class or its `getByte()` method. However, C# provides several ways to retrieve data from a database and convert it into a byte array. Here are some possible alternatives:

1. Using ADO.NET: You can use the `SqlDataReader` class in ADO.NET to read data from a SQL Server database and convert it into a byte array using the `GetBytes()` method.
2. Using Entity Framework: You can use the `DbContext` class in Entity Framework to retrieve data from a database and convert it into a byte array using the `ToArray()` method.
3. Using Dapper: You can use the `QueryAsync<byte[]>()` method in Dapper to retrieve data from a database and convert it into a byte array.

It's important to note that these alternatives may have different syntax and behavior than the Java API you mentioned, so you should consult the documentation for each library to learn more about how they work and how to use them effectively.
