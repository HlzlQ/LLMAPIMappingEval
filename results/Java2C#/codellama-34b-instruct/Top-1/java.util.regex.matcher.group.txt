C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.util.regex.matcher.group` method. However, you can use the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match` class in C# to achieve similar functionality.

Here is an example of how you can use the `Match` class to extract groups from a regular expression match:
```
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
        Regex regex = new Regex("(\\w+) (\\w+)");
        Match match = regex.Match(input);

        if (match.Success)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Group 1: {0}", match.Groups[1].Value);
            Console.WriteLine("Group 2: {0}", match.Groups[2].Value);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will output the following:
```
Group 1: The
Group 2: quick
```
As you can see, the `Match` class provides a `Groups` property that contains all the groups captured by the regular expression. You can access each group by its index in the `Groups` collection.
