C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.util.Collections.sort()` method. However, you can use the `System.Linq` namespace to sort collections in C#. Here is an example:
```
using System.Linq;

// Sort a list of integers in ascending order
List<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 };
numbers.Sort();

// Sort a list of strings in descending order
List<string> words = new List<string>() { "hello", "world", "c#" };
words.Sort((x, y) => -x.CompareTo(y));
```
Note that the `System.Linq` namespace provides a variety of methods for sorting collections, including `OrderBy()`, `ThenBy()`, and `OrderByDescending()`. You can use these methods to sort collections in different ways depending on your needs.
