C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.lang.Character.isWhitespace()` method. However, you can use the `char.IsWhiteSpace()` method in C# to achieve similar functionality. This method checks if a character is a whitespace character, such as a space, tab, or line break.

Here's an example of how you can use the `char.IsWhiteSpace()` method in C#:
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        char c = ' ';
        if (char.IsWhiteSpace(c))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The character is a whitespace character.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The character is not a whitespace character.");
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `char.IsWhiteSpace()` method is used to check if the character `c` is a whitespace character. If it is, then the message "The character is a whitespace character." is printed to the console. Otherwise, the message "The character is not a whitespace character." is printed.
