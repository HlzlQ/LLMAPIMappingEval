C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.util.regex.matcher.find` method. However, you can use the `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex` class in C# to perform regular expression matching.

Here is an example of how you might use the `Regex` class to find all occurrences of a pattern in a string:
```
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Define the regular expression pattern
        Regex regex = new Regex("\\d+");

        // Define the input string
        string input = "The answer is 42.";

        // Find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string
        MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(input);

        // Iterate over the matches and print them to the console
        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(match.Value);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will output `42` to the console, since that is the only occurrence of the pattern `\d+` in the input string.
