C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `isinstance` method in Java. However, you can use the `is` keyword to check if an object is an instance of a particular class or interface. Here's an example:
```csharp
if (obj is MyClass) {
    // obj is an instance of MyClass
} else {
    // obj is not an instance of MyClass
}
```
Alternatively, you can use the `GetType()` method to get the type of an object and then compare it with the desired type using the `==` operator. Here's an example:
```csharp
if (obj.GetType() == typeof(MyClass)) {
    // obj is an instance of MyClass
} else {
    // obj is not an instance of MyClass
}
```
Note that in C#, you can also use the `as` keyword to perform a safe cast and check if the object is an instance of a particular class or interface. Here's an example:
```csharp
if (obj as MyClass != null) {
    // obj is an instance of MyClass
} else {
    // obj is not an instance of MyClass
}
```
