C# does not have an exact equivalent to the Java API "java.beans.indexedpropertydescriptor.getIndexedReadMethod". However, C# provides a similar functionality through the use of indexers. An indexer is a property that allows you to access elements in a collection using array syntax.

Here's an example of how you might implement an indexer in C#:
```
public class MyCollection<T>
{
    private List<T> _items = new List<T>();

    public T this[int index]
    {
        get { return _items[index]; }
        set { _items[index] = value; }
    }
}
```
In this example, the `MyCollection` class has an indexer that allows you to access elements in the collection using array syntax. The indexer is defined as a property with a getter and a setter, which allows you to retrieve or modify the element at a given index.

You can use this indexer in your C# code like this:
```
MyCollection<string> myCollection = new MyCollection<string>();
myCollection[0] = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(myCollection[0]); // Outputs "Hello"
```
Note that the `this` keyword is used to define an indexer, which allows you to access the element at a given index using array syntax.
