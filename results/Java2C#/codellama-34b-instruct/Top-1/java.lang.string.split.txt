C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `split` method in Java's `String` class. However, you can use the `Split` method in C#'s `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespace to achieve similar functionality.

Here is an example of how you could use the `Split` method in C#:
```
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string input = "hello world";
        string[] words = Regex.Split(input, @"\s+");

        foreach (string word in words)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(word);
        }
    }
}
```
This code will split the `input` string into an array of substrings using the regular expression `\s+`, which matches one or more whitespace characters. The resulting array is then iterated over and each element is printed to the console.
