C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.util.Map` interface. However, there are several options available in C# that can be used as an alternative to `java.util.Map`. Here are some of them:

1. `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`: This is a generic class that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It provides similar functionality to `java.util.Map`, and can be used as a direct replacement in many cases.
2. `System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>`: This is a thread-safe implementation of the `Dictionary` class. It provides similar functionality to `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`, which is often used as an alternative to `java.util.Map` in Java.
3. `System.Collections.Specialized.NameObjectCollectionBase<TKey, TValue>`: This is a base class for collections of key-value pairs that are stored in a name-object pair. It provides similar functionality to `java.util.Properties`, which is often used as an alternative to `java.util.Map` in Java.
4. `System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`: This is a class that represents a collection of key-value pairs that are stored in a specific order. It provides similar functionality to `java.util.LinkedHashMap`, which is often used as an alternative to `java.util.Map` in Java.

It's important to note that the choice of which API to use will depend on the specific requirements of your application, and there may be other options available in C# that can also be used as alternatives to `java.util.Map`.
