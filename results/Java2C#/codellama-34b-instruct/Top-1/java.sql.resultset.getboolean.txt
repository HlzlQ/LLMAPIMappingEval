C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.sql.ResultSet` class or its `getBoolean()` method. However, C# provides several ways to retrieve data from a database and convert it to a boolean value. Here are some possible alternatives:

1. Using ADO.NET: You can use the `SqlDataReader` class in ADO.NET to read data from a SQL Server database and convert it to a boolean value using the `GetBoolean()` method.
2. Using Entity Framework: You can use the `DbContext` class in Entity Framework to retrieve data from a database and convert it to a boolean value using the `ToBoolean()` extension method.
3. Using Dapper: You can use the `Query<T>` method in Dapper to retrieve data from a database and convert it to a boolean value using the `ToBoolean()` extension method.

It's important to note that the specific API you choose will depend on your project requirements and the technologies you are already using.
