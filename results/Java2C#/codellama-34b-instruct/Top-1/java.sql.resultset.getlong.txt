C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.sql.ResultSet` class or its `getLong()` method. However, C# provides several ways to retrieve data from a database and convert it to a long integer value. Here are some possible options:

1. Using ADO.NET: You can use the `SqlDataReader` class in C# to read data from a SQL Server database. The `GetInt64()` method of this class can be used to retrieve a long integer value from a column in the result set.
2. Using Entity Framework: If you are using Entity Framework, you can use the `DbContext` class to query the database and retrieve data as objects. You can then use the `long` property of these objects to get the long integer value.
3. Using Dapper: Dapper is a popular micro-ORM for .NET that allows you to execute SQL queries and map the results to C# objects. You can use the `Query<T>` method of the `Dapper.SqlMapper` class to retrieve data from the database as objects, and then use the `long` property of these objects to get the long integer value.

It's worth noting that the exact API you choose will depend on your specific requirements and the technology stack you are using in your project.
