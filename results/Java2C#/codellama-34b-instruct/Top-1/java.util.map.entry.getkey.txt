C# does not have an exact equivalent to the Java `Map.Entry` interface. However, you can use a `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>` struct in C# to achieve similar functionality. The `KeyValuePair` struct has two properties: `Key` and `Value`, which correspond to the `getKey()` and `getValue()` methods of the Java `Map.Entry` interface.

Here is an example of how you can use a `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>` in C#:
```
var entry = new KeyValuePair<string, int>("key", 123);
Console.WriteLine(entry.Key); // Output: "key"
Console.WriteLine(entry.Value); // Output: 123
```
