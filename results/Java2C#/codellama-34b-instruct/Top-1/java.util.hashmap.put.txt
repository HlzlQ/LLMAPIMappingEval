C# does not have a direct equivalent to the Java `HashMap` class. However, you can use the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class in C# to achieve similar functionality. The `put()` method in Java is used to add or update an entry in the map, and the equivalent method in C# is `Add()`.

Here's an example of how you could use the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class in C# to create a map that behaves similarly to a Java `HashMap`:
```
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Create a new dictionary with string keys and integer values
var map = new Dictionary<string, int>();

// Add or update an entry in the map
map.Add("key1", 1);
map.Add("key2", 2);

// Get the value associated with a key
int value = map["key1"];

// Remove an entry from the map
map.Remove("key1");
```
