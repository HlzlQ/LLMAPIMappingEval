C# does not have an exact equivalent to the `java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols` class. However, you can use the `System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo` class to achieve similar functionality in C#.

The `GetGroupSeparator()` method in Java is used to get the character that is used as a group separator in numbers. In C#, you can use the `NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyGroupSeparator` property to get the same information.

Here's an example of how you can use the `NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyGroupSeparator` property in C#:
```
using System.Globalization;

// Get the current culture's NumberFormatInfo object
NumberFormatInfo nfi = CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat;

// Get the group separator character
char groupSeparator = nfi.CurrencyGroupSeparator;

Console.WriteLine("Group separator: {0}", groupSeparator);
```
This code will output the group separator character for the current culture, which is typically a comma (",") in many cultures.
