C# does not have a direct equivalent to the `java.lang.StringBuffer` class or its `deleteCharAt()` method. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `System.Text.StringBuilder` class in C#.

Here is an example of how you could use the `StringBuilder` class to delete a character at a specific index:
```
using System.Text;

// Create a new StringBuilder object with the string "hello"
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("hello");

// Delete the character at index 2 (the third character)
sb.Remove(2, 1);

// Print the modified string
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); // Output: helo
```
