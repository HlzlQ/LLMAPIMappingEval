JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java, and AssertEquals is one of its core methods. In C#, there are several alternatives to JUnit and AssertEquals, but some of the closest matches include:

1. NUnit: A popular unit testing framework for .NET, similar to JUnit.
2. Assert.AreEqual(): A method in NUnit that compares two objects for equality, similar to JUnit's AssertEquals.
3. Assert.IsTrue(): A method in NUnit that asserts that a condition is true, similar to JUnit's AssertTrue.
4. Assert.IsFalse(): A method in NUnit that asserts that a condition is false, similar to JUnit's AssertFalse.
5. Assert.AreSame(): A method in NUnit that compares two objects for reference equality, similar to JUnit's AssertSame.
6. Assert.IsNotNull(): A method in NUnit that asserts that an object is not null, similar to JUnit's AssertNotNull.
7. Assert.IsNull(): A method in NUnit that asserts that an object is null, similar to JUnit's AssertNull.
8. Assert.AreEqualIgnoringCase(): A method in NUnit that compares two strings for equality, ignoring case, similar to JUnit's AssertEqualsIgnoreCase.
9. Assert.IsInstanceOfType(): A method in NUnit that asserts that an object is an instance of a particular type, similar to JUnit's AssertInstanceOf.
10. Assert.IsAssignableFrom(): A method in NUnit that asserts that one type can be assigned from another, similar to JUnit's AssertAssignableFrom.
