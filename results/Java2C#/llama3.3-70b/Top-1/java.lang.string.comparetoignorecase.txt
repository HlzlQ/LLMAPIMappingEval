System.String.CompareToIgnoreCase does not exist, but the closest equivalent is 
System.String.Equals with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase or 
System.String.Compare with StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase. 

However, a more direct equivalent would be:
System.String.Equals(string, string, StringComparison) 

So the answer is: 
System.String.Equals
