1. System.Environment.ProcessorCount
2. System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Threads.Count
3. System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach()
4. System.Threading.ThreadPool.SetMinThreads()
5. System.Threading.ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads()

These mappings are based on the functionality of `java.lang.runtime.availableprocessors`, which likely refers to querying or managing the number of available processors in a system, and finding corresponding C# APIs that perform similar functions.
