### Mapping PyTorch to TensorFlow

To map the `torch.distributions.bernoulli.Bernoulli` API to its equivalent in TensorFlow, we need to identify the corresponding functions or classes in TensorFlow that perform similar operations. Here are 10 most likely TensorFlow APIs:

1. `tfp.distributions.Bernoulli`
2. `tf.keras.layers.Dense` (for creating a Bernoulli distribution)
3. `tf.random.uniform` (for sampling from a Bernoulli distribution)
4. `tf.math.sigmoid` (to convert logits to probabilities)
5. `tf.nn.relu` (or similar activation functions for binary classification tasks)
6. `tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy` (for computing the loss function)
7. `tf.summary.histogram` (for logging histograms of the distribution parameters)
8. `tf.function` (for defining a TensorFlow graph to improve performance)
9. `tf.GradientTape` (for automatic differentiation in TensorFlow)
10. `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` (for optimization with the Bernoulli distribution)

These mappings are based on common functionalities and operations typically associated with probability distributions, sampling, and machine learning tasks in both frameworks.
