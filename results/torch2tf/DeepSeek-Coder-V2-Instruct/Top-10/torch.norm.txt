### Mapping PyTorch to TensorFlow

To map the `torch.norm` function from PyTorch to its equivalent in TensorFlow, we first need to understand what `torch.norm` does. It computes the norm of a given tensor. The most likely TensorFlow API that performs this operation is `tf.norm`. Here are the names of 10 APIs that could be used for similar operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# List of potential TensorFlow APIs to map to PyTorch's torch.norm
tensorflow_apis = [
    "tf.norm",
    "tf.linalg.norm",  # More comprehensive norm function
    "tf.reduce_norm",   # Reduces a dimension by computing the norm
    "tf.math.reduce_norm",  # Similar to reduce_norm but part of tf.math
    "tf.nn.l2_loss",     # Computes half the L2 norm of a tensor without the square root
    "tf.keras.backend.sqrt",  # Takes the square root after computing the L2 norm
    "tf.reduce_sum",      # Reduces dimensions by summing, could be used indirectly for norms
    "tf.math.reduce_sum",  # Similar to reduce_sum but part of tf.math
    "tf.linalg.vector_norm",  # Computes the norm of vectors
    "tf.linalg.matrix_norm"   # Computes the norm of matrices
]
```

These APIs cover a range of functionalities similar to what `torch.norm` provides, including different types of norms (L1, L2), reduction operations, and more specialized functions for vectors and matrices.
