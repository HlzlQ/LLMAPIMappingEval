### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **PyTorch `torch.nn.PixelShuffle`**: This is a PyTorch layer used for sub-pixel convolution (also known as PixelShuffle). It rearranges elements in a tensor of the shape `[..., C*r^2, H, W]` to a new shape `[..., C, H*r, W*r]`, where `r` is an upscale factor.

2. **TensorFlow Equivalent**: TensorFlow does not have a direct equivalent for PyTorch's `PixelShuffle`. However, there are several layers in TensorFlow that can achieve similar functionality:
   - **tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose**: This layer performs transposed convolution (also known as deconvolution), which can be used to upsample the image but does not have a direct equivalent for the exact pixel rearrangement of `PixelShuffle`.
   - **tf.image.resize**: This function resizes images using various algorithms, including nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation. It is more flexible than convolution layers but does not directly perform the pixel rearrangement as in PyTorch's `PixelShuffle`.
   - **tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D**: This layer performs simple upsampling by a given factor using either nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation. It does not have the specific pixel rearrangement feature of `PixelShuffle`.
   - **tf.keras.layers.DepthwiseConv2D**: This layer performs depth-wise convolution, which can be used for image upscaling but does not directly match the pixel rearrangement functionality of PyTorch's `PixelShuffle`.
   - **tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D**: This layer performs a depth-wise spatial convolution followed by a pointwise convolution, useful for efficient image processing but lacks direct equivalent for the exact pixel rearrangement in `PixelShuffle`.

### Conclusion:
The closest TensorFlow equivalents to PyTorch's `PixelShuffle` are not straightforward due to the lack of a direct counterpart. However, considering the functionality and similarity, here are five TensorFlow layers that could be used for similar purposes or serve as close alternatives:
1. **tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose**
2. **tf.image.resize**
3. **tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D**
4. **tf.keras.layers.DepthwiseConv2D**
5. **tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D**
