Here are ten possible TensorFlow APIs that can be used for the same functionality as PyTorch's `torch.nn.Conv1d`:

1. `tf.keras.layers.Conv1D`
2. `tf.keras.layers.Convolution1D`
3. `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` (with a kernel size of 1)
4. `tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv1D`
5. `tf.keras.layers.DepthwiseConv2D` (with a kernel size of 1)
6. `tf.keras.layers.Conv3D` (with a kernel size of 1)
7. `tf.keras.layers.SeparableConv2D` (with a kernel size of 1)
8. `tf.keras.layers.DepthwiseConv3D` (with a kernel size of 1)
9. `tf.keras.layers.ConvTranspose1D`
10. `tf.keras.layers.ConvTranspose2D` (with a kernel size of 1)
