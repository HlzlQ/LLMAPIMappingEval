Here are five possible TensorFlow APIs that can be used for orthogonal initialization:

1. `tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal`
2. `tf.keras.initializers.RandomNormal` with `mean=0` and `stddev=1`
3. `tf.keras.initializers.TruncatedNormal` with `mean=0` and `stddev=1`
4. `tf.keras.initializers.VarianceScaling` with `scale=2`, `mode='fan_in'`, and `distribution='normal'`
5. `tf.keras.initializers.GlorotNormal`

Note that these are just a few examples, and there may be other TensorFlow APIs that can be used for orthogonal initialization as well.
