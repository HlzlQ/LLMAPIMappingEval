Here are five possible TensorFlow APIs that can be used for zero-padding a tensor:

1. `tf.pad` - This API allows you to pad a tensor with a specified number of zeros along each dimension.
2. `tf.zeros_like` - This API creates a new tensor with the same shape as an input tensor, but filled with zeros.
3. `tf.fill` - This API fills a tensor with a specified value, which can be used to create a zero-padded tensor.
4. `tf.pad_with_zeros` - This API is similar to `tf.pad`, but it pads the input tensor with zeros instead of a specific value.
5. `tf.zero_padding` - This API creates a new tensor with the same shape as an input tensor, but filled with zeros. It also allows you to specify the padding size and dimension.
