Here are five possible TensorFlow APIs that can be used for splitting a tensor:

1. `tf.split`: This API splits a tensor into multiple sub-tensors along a specified axis. It takes the input tensor, the number of splits, and the axis to split along as arguments.
2. `tf.unstack`: This API is similar to `tf.split`, but it returns a list of tensors instead of a tuple. It also takes the input tensor, the number of splits, and the axis to split along as arguments.
3. `tf.slice`: This API extracts a slice from a tensor. It takes the input tensor, the start index, and the end index (exclusive) as arguments.
4. `tf.strided_slice`: This API is similar to `tf.slice`, but it allows for striding along the sliced dimension. It takes the input tensor, the start index, the end index (exclusive), the stride, and the axis to slice along as arguments.
5. `tf.tile_split`: This API splits a tensor into multiple sub-tensors by tiling it along a specified axis. It takes the input tensor, the number of tiles, and the axis to tile along as arguments.
