Here are five possible CNTK APIs that correspond to the `torch.load` function:

1. `cntk.io.load_model`: Loads a trained model from a file or directory.
2. `cntk.io.load_data`: Loads data from a file or directory for training or testing.
3. `cntk.io.load_labels`: Loads labels from a file or directory for training or testing.
4. `cntk.io.load_weights`: Loads model weights from a file or directory.
5. `cntk.io.load_optimizer`: Loads the optimizer state from a file or directory.
