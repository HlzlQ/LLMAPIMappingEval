Here are five possible CNTK APIs that correspond to the PyTorch `torch.save` function:

1. `cntk.save_model`: Saves a trained model to a file.
2. `cntk.save_weights`: Saves the weights of a trained model to a file.
3. `cntk.save_optimizer`: Saves the optimizer state of a trained model to a file.
4. `cntk.save_loss`: Saves the loss function of a trained model to a file.
5. `cntk.save_metrics`: Saves the metrics of a trained model to a file.
