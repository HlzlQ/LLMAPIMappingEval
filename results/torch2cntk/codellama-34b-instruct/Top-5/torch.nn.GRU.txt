Here are five possible CNTK APIs that correspond to the PyTorch `torch.nn.GRU` API:

1. `cntk.layers.RecurrentBlock`: This is a general-purpose recurrent layer that can be used to implement a GRU cell.
2. `cntk.layers.GRU`: This is a pre-defined GRU layer that can be used directly in your model.
3. `cntk.layers.RNN`: This is a more general RNN layer that can be configured to use a GRU cell.
4. `cntk.layers.LSTM`: This is a pre-defined LSTM layer that can be used as an alternative to GRU.
5. `cntk.layers.Sequential`: This is a sequential container for layers, which can be used to implement a GRU cell by stacking multiple RNN cells.
