CNTK does not have a direct equivalent to `torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d`. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the `convolution_transpose` function in CNTK. Here's an example:
```csharp
using CNTK;

// Define the convolution transpose layer
var convT = new ConvolutionTranspose(
    numFilters: 64,
    kernelSize: (3, 3),
    stride: (2, 2),
    padding: (1, 1)
);

// Create a variable for the input data
var input = Variable.InputVariable(shape: (3, 3, 3), dataType: DataType.Float);

// Apply the convolution transpose layer to the input data
var output = convT.Forward(input);
```
In this example, we define a `ConvolutionTranspose` layer with 64 filters, a kernel size of (3, 3), and a stride of (2, 2). We also set the padding to (1, 1) to ensure that the output shape is the same as the input shape.

We then create a variable for the input data and apply the convolution transpose layer to it using the `Forward` method. The resulting output will have the same shape as the input data, but with the filters applied in the reverse direction (i.e., from the bottom up).
