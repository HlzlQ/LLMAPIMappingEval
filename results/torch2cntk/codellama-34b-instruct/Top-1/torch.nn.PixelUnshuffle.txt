CNTK does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.nn.PixelUnshuffle`. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using the `CNTK.layers.ConvolutionTranspose` layer with a stride of 2 and a kernel size of 3x3. This will perform a transposed convolution operation that effectively reduces the spatial dimensions of the input tensor by half.

Here's an example code snippet:
```csharp
using CNTK;

// Define the input shape
var inputShape = new int[] { 1, 3, 256, 256 }; // (batch size, channels, height, width)

// Create a convolution transpose layer with stride 2 and kernel size 3x3
var convTransposeLayer = CNTK.layers.ConvolutionTranspose(inputShape, numFilters: 1, kernelSize: new int[] { 3, 3 }, strides: new int[] { 2, 2 });

// Define the output shape
var outputShape = convTransposeLayer.OutputShape; // (batch size, channels, height, width)
```
Note that the `ConvolutionTranspose` layer in CNTK does not have a built-in `PixelUnshuffle` function like PyTorch's `nn.PixelUnshuffle`. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using the `ConvolutionTranspose` layer with a stride of 2 and a kernel size of 3x3, which will reduce the spatial dimensions of the input tensor by half.
