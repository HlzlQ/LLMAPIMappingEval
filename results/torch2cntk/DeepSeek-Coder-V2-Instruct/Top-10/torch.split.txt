Answer: torch.chunk, torch.tensor_split, torch.as_strided, torch.unfold, torch.split, torch.reshape, torch.view, torch.resize_, torch.transpose, torch.permute  CNTK API Mapping for PyTorch FunctionsHere is a mapping of the most likely CNTK APIs to the PyTorch functions provided:1. `torch.chunk` -> Not directly available in CNTK; consider using `C.split` with appropriate arguments.2. `torch.tensor_split` -> Not available in CNTK; consider custom logic for splitting tensors.3. `torch.as_strided` -> Not available in CNTK; consider custom tensor creation or reshaping techniques.4. `torch.unfold` -> Not available in CNTK; consider manual slicing and stacking operations.5. `torch.split` -> Available as `C.split` in CNTK, which can be used to split tensors along specified dimensions.6. `torch.reshape` -> Available as `C.Reshape` in CNTK, which reshapes the tensor to new dimensions.7. `torch.view` -> Available as `C.Reshape` or `C.TransposeDimensions` in CNTK, depending on the transformation needed.8. `torch.resize_` -> Not available in CNTK; consider creating a new tensor with desired shape and copying data if necessary.9. `torch.transpose` -> Available as `C.TransposeDimensions` in CNTK, which transposes the dimensions of the tensor.10. `torch.permute` -> Available as `C.TransposeDimensions` or `C.ReorderDimensions` in CNTK, depending on the specific permutation needed.These mappings are based on common functionalities and available operations in both PyTorch and CNTK. For more complex functions or those not listed here, additional custom logic may be required to replicate the behavior in CNTK.
