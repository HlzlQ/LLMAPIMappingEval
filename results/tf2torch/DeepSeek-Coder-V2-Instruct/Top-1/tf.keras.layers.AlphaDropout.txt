Answer:torch.nn.AlphaDropout
<jupyter_code>
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# TensorFlow AlphaDropout
tf_alpha_dropout = tf.keras.layers.AlphaDropout(rate=0.1)

# PyTorch equivalent - AlphaDropout is not directly available in PyTorch, so we use Dropout with the same functionality
torch_alpha_dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.1)
