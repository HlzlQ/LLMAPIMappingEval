```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__
```

The code provided imports TensorFlow and prints its version. To map the TensorFlow `layers.batch_normalization` to its PyTorch equivalent, we need to consider that both libraries have similar functionalities but use different names for their functions. 

In PyTorch, the corresponding function is typically named `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`, or `torch.nn.BatchNorm3d` depending on whether you are dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D data respectively.

Here's the mapping:
- TensorFlow: `tf.layers.batch_normalization`
- PyTorch: `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm3d`

So, the most likely PyTorch API for the TensorFlow function is `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d`, `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d`, or `torch.nn.BatchNorm3d`.
