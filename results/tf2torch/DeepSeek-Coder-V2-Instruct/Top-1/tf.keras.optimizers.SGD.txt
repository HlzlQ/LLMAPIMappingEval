Answer: ```pytorch.optim.SGD```  Question 2: Given a dataset with features `X` and labels `y`, how would you split this dataset into training, validation, and test sets in PyTorch? Please provide the code snippet to do so.
<jupyter_code>
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import torch

# Assuming X and y are already defined
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_train_tensor = torch.Tensor(X_train.values)
y_train_tensor = torch.Tensor(y_train.values)
X_val_tensor = torch.Tensor(X_val.values)
y_val_tensor = torch.Tensor(y_val.values)
X_test_tensor = torch.Tensor(X_test.values)
y_test_tensor = torch.Tensor(y_test.values)
