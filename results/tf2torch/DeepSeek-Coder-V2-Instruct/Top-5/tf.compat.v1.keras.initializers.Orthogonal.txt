# Step 1: Understand the task
# The user is asking for a mapping between two different deep learning frameworks' initialization methods.
# We need to find equivalent initializers in PyTorch for the given TensorFlow initializer.

# Step 2: Identify the TensorFlow initializer
# The TensorFlow initializer provided is "tensorflow.compat.v1.keras.initializers.Orthogonal".

# Step 3: Find equivalent initializers in PyTorch
# We need to find five most likely initializers in PyTorch that have similar functionality to Orthogonal initializer from TensorFlow.

# Step 4: List the equivalent initializers in PyTorch
# Based on common initialization methods used in both frameworks, here are the top 5 likely candidates for mapping:

# 1. `torch.nn.init.orthogonal_` - This is a direct counterpart to TensorFlow's Orthogonal initializer.
# 2. `torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_` - A popular initializer similar in spirit, useful for layers where the incoming and outgoing signals have the same variance.
# 3. `torch.nn.init.kaiming_uniform_` - Often used for deep learning models, especially those with ReLU or its variants as activation functions.
# 4. `torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_` - Similar to `kaiming_uniform_`, but samples from a normal distribution instead of uniform.
# 5. `torch.nn.init.lecun_uniform_` - Specifically designed for layers in convolutional neural networks, ensuring that the variance of the outputs is the same across the layer.

# Output:
"""
1. torch.nn.init.orthogonal_
2. torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_
3. torch.nn.init.kaiming_uniform_
4. torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_
5. torch.nn.init.lecun_uniform_
