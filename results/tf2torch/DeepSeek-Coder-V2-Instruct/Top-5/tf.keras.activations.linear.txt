```python
import torch
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the TensorFlow function**: The task is to find a TensorFlow API equivalent to PyTorch's activation functions.
2. **Map TensorFlow activations to PyTorch equivalents**: We need to identify the most likely PyTorch APIs that match the TensorFlow ones.
3. **Output the names of the 5 most likely PyTorch APIs**: These should be the direct equivalents or similar functionalities in PyTorch.

### Solution:
```python
import torch

# Mapping TensorFlow activation functions to PyTorch equivalents
tensorflow_activations = ['linear', 'relu', 'sigmoid', 'tanh', 'softmax']
pytorch_equivalents = [
    'identity',  # Equivalent to linear in TensorFlow
    'ReLU',      # Direct equivalent of TensorFlow's relu
    'Sigmoid',   # Direct equivalent of TensorFlow's sigmoid
    'Tanh',      # Direct equivalent of TensorFlow's tanh
    'Softmax'    # Equivalent to TensorFlow's softmax (note: PyTorch uses different parameters for the axis)
]
```

### Explanation:
- **identity**: This is a direct equivalent of TensorFlow's linear activation function, which in PyTorch is simply `torch.nn.Identity()`. However, since we are looking for names and not classes, 'identity' is used here as it represents the same concept.
- **ReLU**: Directly maps to TensorFlow's relu due to similarity in functionality.
- **Sigmoid**: Maps directly to TensorFlow's sigmoid function.
- **Tanh**: Maps directly to TensorFlow's tanh function.
- **Softmax**: While PyTorch uses `torch.nn.functional.softmax` with an additional parameter for the axis, 'Softmax' is used here as it represents the same concept in a more common usage context.

### Final Answer:
```python
tensorflow_activations = ['linear', 'relu', 'sigmoid', 'tanh', 'softmax']
pytorch_equivalents = ['identity', 'ReLU', 'Sigmoid', 'Tanh', 'Softmax']
```
