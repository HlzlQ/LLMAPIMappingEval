```python
import torch
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understand the TensorFlow API**: The `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.Flatten` is a layer in TensorFlow that flattens the dimensions of the input tensor except for the batch dimension.
2. **Identify Equivalent PyTorch Functions**: In PyTorch, similar functionality can be achieved using the `torch.nn.Flatten` layer or by using reshape operations.
3. **List 5 Most Likely APIs in PyTorch**: Based on the functionality of flattening tensors, here are five likely PyTorch APIs:
   - `torch.nn.Flatten`: This is a specific layer for flattening dimensions.
   - `torch.reshape`: This function can be used to reshape tensors.
   - `torch.view`: Similar to `torch.reshape`, it allows reshaping of tensors.
   - `torch.flatten`: A method that flattens the input tensor, similar to TensorFlow's Flatten layer.
   - `torch.Tensor.view`: Another way to reshape tensors in PyTorch.

### Final Answer:
```python
["torch.nn.Flatten", "torch.reshape", "torch.view", "torch.flatten", "torch.Tensor.view"]
```
