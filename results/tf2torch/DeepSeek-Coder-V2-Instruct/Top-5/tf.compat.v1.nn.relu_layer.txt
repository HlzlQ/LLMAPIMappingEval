## Step-by-step solution:

To find the equivalent PyTorch function for the given TensorFlow API `tensorflow.compat.v1.nn.relu_layer`, we need to identify functions in PyTorch that perform similar operations. Here are five likely candidates based on their functionality:

1. **torch.nn.ReLU**: This is a direct equivalent of TensorFlow's ReLU activation function. It applies the Rectified Linear Unit function element-wise.
2. **torch.nn.functional.relu**: Similar to `torch.nn.ReLU`, this is also an implementation of the ReLU function, but it is part of the functional API in PyTorch and can be used without defining a layer in a model.
3. **torch.nn.Linear**: This is equivalent to TensorFlow's fully connected (dense) layer, which performs a linear transformation followed by an optional activation function.
4. **torch.matmul**: While not exactly an activation function, `torch.matmul` can be used for matrix multiplication, which is often involved in dense layers where weights are applied.
5. **torch.nn.Sequential**: This allows chaining of multiple layers together, similar to how TensorFlow's sequential model building is done.

These functions cover the basic operations that would replace the functionality provided by `tensorflow.compat.v1.nn.relu_layer`.
