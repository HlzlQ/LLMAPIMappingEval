import torch
```

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Tensor Initialization**: Both TensorFlow and PyTorch provide functions to initialize tensors with specific values. In TensorFlow, `tf.zeros_initializer` is used for this purpose, while in PyTorch, you can use `torch.zeros` or other tensor initialization methods.

2. **API Mapping**: Here are the 10 most likely APIs that have similar functionalities between TensorFlow and PyTorch:
   - `tf.zeros_initializer` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.zeros` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.ones_initializer` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.ones` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.fill` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.full` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.constant` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.tensor` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.zeros` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.zeros` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.ones` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.ones` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.random_normal` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.randn` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.random_uniform` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.rand` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.linspace` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.linspace` (PyTorch).
   - `tf.range` (TensorFlow) maps to `torch.arange` (PyTorch).
