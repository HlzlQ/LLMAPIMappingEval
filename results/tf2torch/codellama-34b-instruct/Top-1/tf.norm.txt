PyTorch does not have a direct equivalent of `tf.norm`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `torch.linalg.norm`: Computes the matrix norm of a tensor.
* `torch.linalg.vector_norm`: Computes the vector norm of a tensor.
* `torch.linalg.matrix_norm`: Computes the matrix norm of a tensor.

For example, to compute the L2 norm of a tensor in PyTorch, you can use the following code:
```
import torch

tensor = torch.randn(3, 4)
norm = torch.linalg.vector_norm(tensor, dim=1)
print(norm)
```
This will output a tensor with shape `(3,)` containing the L2 norm of each row in `tensor`.
