Here are five PyTorch APIs that have similar functionality to TensorFlow's GRU layer:

1. `nn.GRU` - This is a basic GRU layer implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and outputs hidden states of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
2. `nn.GRUCell` - This is a single GRU cell implementation in PyTorch. It takes an input tensor of shape (input_size) and outputs a hidden state of shape (hidden_size).
3. `nn.RNN` - This is a basic RNN layer implementation in PyTorch that can be used to implement a GRU layer. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and outputs hidden states of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
4. `nn.LSTM` - This is an LSTM layer implementation in PyTorch that can be used to implement a GRU layer. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and outputs hidden states of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
5. `nn.GRUModule` - This is a PyTorch module that implements the GRU layer using the `nn.GRUCell` class. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and outputs hidden states of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
