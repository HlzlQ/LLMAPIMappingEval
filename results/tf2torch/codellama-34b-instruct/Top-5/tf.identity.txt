Here are five PyTorch APIs that have similar functionality to TensorFlow's `tensorflow.identity`:

1. `torch.eye` - Creates a 2D identity tensor with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
2. `torch.ones_like` - Creates a tensor of all ones with the same shape as the input tensor.
3. `torch.zeros_like` - Creates a tensor of all zeros with the same shape as the input tensor.
4. `torch.diag` - Extracts the diagonal elements of a matrix or a batch of matrices.
5. `torch.eye_like` - Creates an identity tensor with the same shape and type as the input tensor, but with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
