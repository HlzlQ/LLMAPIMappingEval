Here are five PyTorch APIs that can be used for implementing LSTM layers:

1. `nn.LSTM` - This is a basic LSTM layer implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and returns output tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
2. `nn.LSTMCell` - This is a basic LSTM cell implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, input_size) and returns output tensors of shape (batch_size, hidden_size).
3. `nn.GRU` - This is a basic GRU layer implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and returns output tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).
4. `nn.GRUCell` - This is a basic GRU cell implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, input_size) and returns output tensors of shape (batch_size, hidden_size).
5. `nn.RNN` - This is a basic RNN layer implementation in PyTorch. It takes input tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, input_size) and returns output tensors of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size).

Note that these are just some examples of PyTorch APIs for implementing LSTM layers, and there may be other options available depending on your specific use case.
