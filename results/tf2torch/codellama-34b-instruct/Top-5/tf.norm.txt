Here are five PyTorch APIs that have similar functionality to the TensorFlow API `tensorflow.norm`:

1. `torch.norm` - Computes the norm of a tensor.
2. `torch.linalg.norm` - Computes the matrix or vector norm.
3. `torch.nn.functional.normalize` - Normalizes a tensor by dividing it by its L2 norm.
4. `torch.nn.functional.batch_norm` - Applies batch normalization to a tensor.
5. `torch.nn.functional.instance_norm` - Applies instance normalization to a tensor.
