Here are five PyTorch APIs that are similar to TensorFlow's `tensorflow.tensordot`:

1. `torch.dot` - Computes the dot product of two tensors.
2. `torch.matmul` - Computes the matrix product of two tensors.
3. `torch.einsum` - Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.
4. `torch.tensordot` - Computes the tensor dot product of two tensors.
5. `torch.inner` - Computes the inner product of two tensors.
