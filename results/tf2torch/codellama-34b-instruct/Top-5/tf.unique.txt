Here are five PyTorch APIs that have similar functionality to TensorFlow's `unique`:

1. `torch.unique` - This API returns the unique elements of a tensor, along with their indices in the original tensor.
2. `torch.unique_dim` - This API returns the unique elements of a specific dimension of a tensor, along with their indices in the original tensor.
3. `torch.unique_rows` - This API returns the unique rows of a 2D tensor, along with their indices in the original tensor.
4. `torch.unique_cols` - This API returns the unique columns of a 2D tensor, along with their indices in the original tensor.
5. `torch.unique_values` - This API returns the unique values of a tensor, along with their indices in the original tensor.
