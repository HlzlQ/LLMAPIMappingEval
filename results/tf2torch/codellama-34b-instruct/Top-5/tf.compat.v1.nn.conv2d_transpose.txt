Here are five possible PyTorch APIs that can be used for the same functionality as TensorFlow's `tf.compat.v1.nn.conv2d_transpose`:

1. `torch.nn.functional.conv_transpose2d`
2. `torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d`
3. `torch.nn.modules.conv.ConvTranspose2d`
4. `torch.nn.modules.conv.ConvTranspose3d` (for 3D convolutions)
5. `torch.nn.functional.conv_transpose1d` (for 1D convolutions)
