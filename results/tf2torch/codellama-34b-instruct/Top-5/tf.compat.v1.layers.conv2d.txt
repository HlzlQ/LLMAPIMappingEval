Here are five possible PyTorch APIs that can be used for convolutional layers:

1. torch.nn.Conv2d
2. torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d
3. torch.nn.Conv1d
4. torch.nn.Conv3d
5. torch.nn.Conv2dSame

Note that the first four APIs are similar to TensorFlow's `tf.layers.conv2d` API, while the last one is a PyTorch-specific API for convolutional layers with the same padding as TensorFlow's `SAME` padding mode.
