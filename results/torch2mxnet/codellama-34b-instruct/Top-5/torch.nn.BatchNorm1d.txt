  BatchNorm1d is a layer in both PyTorch and MXNet that normalizes the activations of a neural network. Here are the five most likely MXNet APIs with the same functionality as PyTorch's BatchNorm1d:

  1. mxnet.gluon.nn.BatchNorm
2. mxnet.gluon.nn.InstanceNorm
3. mxnet.gluon.nn.LayerNorm
4. mxnet.gluon.nn.GroupNorm
5. mxnet.gluon.nn.WeightedNorm
