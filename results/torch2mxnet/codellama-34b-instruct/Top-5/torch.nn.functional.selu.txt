  SELU (Self-Normalizing Exponential Linear Unit) is a type of activation function used in deep neural networks. It is similar to the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) but has some key differences:

* SELU is defined as: f(x) = scale \* g(x) where g(x) = x if x > 0 and g(x) = alpha \* (exp(x) - 1) if x <= 0.
* The "scale" parameter controls the range of the output values, while the "alpha" parameter controls the rate at which the output saturates.
* SELU is computationally efficient and is less prone to dying neurons compared to ReLU.

Here are five MXNet APIs that can be used as an alternative to PyTorch's torch.nn.functional.selu:

1. mxnet.ndarray.SELU - This API applies the SELU activation function element-wise to a tensor.
2. mxnet.gluon.nn.SELU - This API is similar to PyTorch's torch.nn.functional.selu and applies the SELU activation function to an input tensor.
3. mxnet.ndarray.leaky_relu - This API applies the Leaky ReLU activation function element-wise to a tensor, which is similar to SELU but with a different alpha value.
4. mxnet.gluon.nn.LeakyReLU - This API is similar to PyTorch's torch.nn.functional.leaky_relu and applies the Leaky ReLU activation function to an input tensor.
5. mxnet.ndarray.prelu - This API applies the Parametric ReLU (PReLU) activation function element-wise to a tensor, which is similar to SELU but with a learnable alpha value.
