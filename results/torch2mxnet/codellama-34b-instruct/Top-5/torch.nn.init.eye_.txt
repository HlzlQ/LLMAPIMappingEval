Here are five possible MXNet APIs that correspond to `torch.nn.init.eye_`:

1. `mxnet.initializers.Eye()`: This initializer creates a tensor with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, similar to `torch.nn.init.eye_`.
2. `mxnet.initializers.Identity()`: This initializer creates a tensor with the same values as the input tensor, but with the main diagonal set to zero.
3. `mxnet.initializers.Ones()`: This initializer creates a tensor with all ones, which can be used to initialize a layer's weights or biases.
4. `mxnet.initializers.Zeros()`: This initializer creates a tensor with all zeros, which can be used to initialize a layer's weights or biases.
5. `mxnet.initializers.Constant()`: This initializer creates a tensor with a constant value, which can be used to initialize a layer's weights or biases.
