MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of PyTorch's `nn.Softmax` module. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `mxnet.ndarray.softmax` function.

Here is an example of how to use `mxnet.ndarray.softmax` in MXNet:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a random tensor with shape (3, 4)
data = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(3, 4))

# Apply softmax function to the last dimension of the tensor
softmax_output = mx.nd.softmax(data, axis=-1)
```
In this example, `mx.nd.softmax` is applied to the last dimension of the input tensor `data`. The resulting output tensor will have the same shape as the input tensor, but with each element representing a probability value between 0 and 1.
