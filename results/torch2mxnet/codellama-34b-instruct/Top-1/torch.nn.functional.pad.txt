MXNet does not have a direct equivalent to PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional.pad`. However, you can achieve similar functionality using MXNet's `mxnet.ndarray.pad` function. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Create a random tensor with shape (3, 4)
data = mx.nd.random.uniform(shape=(3, 4))

# Pad the tensor with zeros on both sides
padded_data = mx.nd.pad(data, pad_width=1, mode='constant')
```
In this example, `mx.nd.pad` is used to pad the input tensor `data` with zeros on both sides. The `pad_width` argument specifies the number of elements to be padded on each side. The `mode` argument specifies the padding mode, which can be either `'constant'` or `'reflect'`.

Note that MXNet's `mx.nd.pad` function only supports 2D padding, so you may need to reshape your tensor before applying padding if it has more than two dimensions.
