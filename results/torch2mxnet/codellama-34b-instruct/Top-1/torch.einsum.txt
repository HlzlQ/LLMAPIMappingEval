MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.einsum`. However, you can use the `mxnet.ndarray.tensordot` function to perform tensor contractions. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Create two tensors
a = mx.nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = mx.nd.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Perform tensor contraction using tensordot
c = mx.nd.tensordot(a, b, axes=[[0], [1]])
print(c)
```
This will output the following tensor:
```python
[[19, 22], [43, 50]]
```
Note that the `axes` argument specifies which axes to contract. In this case, we are contracting the first axis of `a` with the second axis of `b`.
