MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.norm`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.ndarray.Norm`: This API calculates the norm of an array along a specified axis.
* `mxnet.ndarray.LpNorm`: This API calculates the Lp-norm of an array, where p is a positive integer.

For example, to calculate the 2-norm of a tensor in MXNet, you can use the following code:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a tensor
tensor = mx.nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Calculate the 2-norm
norm = mx.nd.Norm(tensor, axis=0)
```
Alternatively, you can use the `LpNorm` API to calculate the L2-norm of a tensor:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a tensor
tensor = mx.nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Calculate the L2-norm
norm = mx.nd.LpNorm(tensor, p=2)
```
