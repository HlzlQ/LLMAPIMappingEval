MXNet does not have a direct equivalent to PyTorch's `torch.nn.RNN` module. However, you can use MXNet's `mxnet.rnn` module to create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. Here is an example of how to create an RNN model using MXNet:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Define the RNN model architecture
model = mx.rnn(num_layers=1, input_size=784, hidden_size=256, output_size=10)

# Initialize the model parameters
model.initialize()
```
In this example, we define an RNN model with one layer and 256 hidden units. The `input_size` parameter specifies the number of input features, and the `output_size` parameter specifies the number of output classes.

Note that MXNet's `rnn` module provides more flexibility than PyTorch's `RNN` module in terms of the types of RNN cells that can be used (e.g., LSTM, GRU, etc.). However, the basic usage and functionality are similar between the two libraries.
