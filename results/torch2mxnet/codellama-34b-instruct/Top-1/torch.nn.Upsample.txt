MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.nn.Upsample`. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `mxnet.ndarray.UpSampling` module. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Create a 2D tensor with shape (1, 3)
data = mx.nd.array([[1, 2, 3]])

# Upsample the data by a factor of 2 along both dimensions
upsampled_data = mx.nd.UpSampling(data, scale=2)
```
In this example, `mx.nd.UpSampling` is used to upsample the input tensor `data` by a factor of 2 along both dimensions. The resulting tensor will have shape `(1, 6)`.
