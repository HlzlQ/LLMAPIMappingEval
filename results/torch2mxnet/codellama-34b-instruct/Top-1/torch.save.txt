MXNet does not have an exact equivalent to `torch.save` from PyTorch. However, you can use the `mxnet.ndarray.save` function to save a MXNet array to a file. Here's an example:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a MXNet array
arr = mx.nd.array([1, 2, 3])

# Save the array to a file
mx.nd.save("my_file.npy", arr)
```
This will save the `arr` array to a file named "my_file.npy" in the current working directory. The file will be saved in the NumPy `.npy` format, which is compatible with PyTorch's `torch.save` function.
