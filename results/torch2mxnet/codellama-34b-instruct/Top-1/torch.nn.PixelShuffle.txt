MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.nn.PixelShuffle`. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using the `mxnet.ndarray.reshape` function to reshape the input tensor into a 4D tensor with shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`, and then using the `mxnet.ndarray.transpose` function to permute the dimensions of the tensor to match the desired output shape.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use MXNet to perform pixel shuffling:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Define a 4D input tensor with shape (batch_size, num_channels, height, width)
input_tensor = mx.nd.array(np.random.rand(10, 3, 256, 256))

# Reshape the input tensor to a 4D tensor with shape (batch_size, num_channels, height, width)
reshaped_tensor = mx.nd.reshape(input_tensor, (10, 3, 256, 256))

# Permute the dimensions of the reshaped tensor to match the desired output shape
output_tensor = mx.nd.transpose(reshaped_tensor, (0, 2, 1, 3))
```
In this example, the `mxnet.ndarray.reshape` function is used to reshape the input tensor into a 4D tensor with shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)`, and then the `mxnet.ndarray.transpose` function is used to permute the dimensions of the reshaped tensor to match the desired output shape. The resulting output tensor will have shape `(batch_size, height, width, num_channels)`.
