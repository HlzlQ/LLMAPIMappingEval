MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.unique`. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the following APIs:

* `mxnet.ndarray.unique`: This API returns the unique elements of an array, along with their indices and counts.
* `mxnet.ndarray.nonzero`: This API returns the indices of the non-zero elements in an array.

You can use these APIs to implement a custom version of `torch.unique` in MXNet. Here's an example:
```scss
import mxnet as mx

def unique(arr):
    # Get the unique elements and their indices
    uniques, indices = mx.ndarray.unique(arr)
    
    # Get the counts of each unique element
    counts = mx.ndarray.nonzero(uniques)
    
    return uniques, indices, counts
```
