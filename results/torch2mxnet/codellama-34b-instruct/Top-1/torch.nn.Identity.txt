MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.nn.Identity`. However, you can use the `mxnet.symbol` module to create an identity function. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Create a symbolic identity function
identity = mx.symbol.Variable('input')

# Use the identity function in a computation graph
output = identity(mx.nd.array([1, 2, 3]))
print(output) # [1, 2, 3]
```
In this example, we create an identity function using `mx.symbol.Variable` and then use it to compute the output of a computation graph. The output is the same as the input, which means that the identity function has not changed the data in any way.
