MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of `torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.ndarray.Convolution`: This API performs a 2D or 3D convolution on an input array. You can set the `transpose` parameter to `True` to perform a transposed convolution.
* `mxnet.ndarray.Deconvolution`: This API performs a 2D or 3D deconvolution on an input array. It is similar to `Convolution`, but it uses a different algorithm that can be more efficient for some types of inputs.

Here's an example of how you might use these APIs:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a 3D convolutional layer with a transposed convolution
conv = mx.ndarray.Convolution(num_filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(2, 2, 2), padding=(1, 1, 1), transpose=True)

# Create a 3D deconvolutional layer
deconv = mx.ndarray.Deconvolution(num_filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(2, 2, 2), padding=(1, 1, 1))
```
