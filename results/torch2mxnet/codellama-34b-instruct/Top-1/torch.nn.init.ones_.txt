MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of `torch.nn.init.ones_`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.initializer.Ones()`: This initializes all elements of a tensor to 1.0.
* `mxnet.initializer.Constant(value=1)`: This initializes all elements of a tensor to a specified value (in this case, 1).

Note that the syntax and behavior of these APIs may differ slightly from the PyTorch API, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
