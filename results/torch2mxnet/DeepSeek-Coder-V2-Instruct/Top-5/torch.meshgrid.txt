## Solution

The equivalent functions in MXNet for the PyTorch `torch.meshgrid` function are:

1. `meshgrid` (MXNet)
2. `broadcast_arrays` (MXNet)
3. `stack` (MXNet)
4. `expand_dims` (MXNet)
5. `tile` (MXNet)

These functions provide similar functionality to PyTorch's `torch.meshgrid`, allowing for the creation of coordinate grids from multiple one-dimensional arrays.
