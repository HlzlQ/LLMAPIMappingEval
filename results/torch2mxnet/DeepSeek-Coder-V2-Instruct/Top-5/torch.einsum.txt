## Solution:
The equivalent function for `torch.einsum` in MXNet is `mxnet.np.einsum`. Here are the five most likely APIs with similar functions in MXNet:

1. `mxnet.np.einsum`: This function performs tensor contraction using Einstein summation convention, which is very similar to PyTorch's `torch.einsum`.
2. `mxnet.ndarray.sum`: Computes the sum of array elements over given axes.
3. `mxnet.ndarray.dot`: Computes the dot product between two arrays.
4. `mxnet.ndarray.batch_dot`: Computes the batch dot product between two arrays.
5. `mxnet.np.tensordot`: Computes tensor dot product along specified axes.
