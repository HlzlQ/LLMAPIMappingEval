## Solution

The PyTorch function `torch.nn.PixelUnshuffle` can be mapped to several MXNet functions due to their similar functionalities. Here are the top 10 API names from MXNet that could potentially have equivalent functionality:

1. **mxnet.ndarray.contrib.pixel_unshuffle**
2. **mxnet.sym.contrib.PixelUnshuffle**
3. **mxnet.gluon.nn.PixelUnshuffle**
4. **mxnet.image.contrib.pixel_unshuffle**
5. **mxnet.contrib.ndarray.PixelUnshuffle**
6. **mxnet.ndarray.PixelUnshuffle**
7. **mxnet.symbol.contrib.PixelUnshuffle**
8. **mxnet.gluon.nn.PixelUnshuffle**
9. **mxnet.image.PixelUnshuffle**
10. **mxnet.contrib.PixelUnshuffle**

These mappings are based on the assumption that MXNet might have similar functionalities implemented in different modules or with slight variations in naming conventions.
