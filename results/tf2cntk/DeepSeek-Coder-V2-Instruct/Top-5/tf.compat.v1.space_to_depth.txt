## Step 2: Generate a list of candidate APIs in CNTK
Based on your understanding of CNTK and its functionalities, generate a list of candidate APIs that might have similar functions to those TensorFlow API mentioned above. Please output the names of these 5 APIs.

## Step 3: Justify your choices for both steps
Provide a brief justification for why you chose each API in step 1 and step 2.

```python
# Your code here for Steps 1, 2, and 3
```

```python
# Step 1: Map TensorFlow API to CNTK API
tensorflow_to_cntk = {
    "tf.space_to_depth": "CNTK.SpaceToDepth",
    # Assuming other APIs are not directly mapped in this example
}

# Step 2: Generate a list of candidate APIs in CNTK
cntk_candidate_apis = [
    "CNTK.Reshape",
    "CNTK.Transpose",
    "CNTK.Slice",
    "CNTK.ExpandDims",
    "CNTK.Squeeze"
]

# Step 3: Justify the choices
# For TensorFlow to CNTK mapping:
# - "tf.space_to_depth" is mapped to "CNTK.SpaceToDepth" because both functions perform a spatial rearrangement of inputs.

# For candidate APIs in CNTK:
# - "CNTK.Reshape": Similar to TensorFlow's reshape, it changes the shape of the tensor.
# - "CNTK.Transpose": Allows the manipulation of axes (dimensions) of a tensor, similar to tf.transpose.
# - "CNTK.Slice": Extracts parts of a tensor, akin to tf.slice or tf.strided_slice in TensorFlow.
# - "CNTK.ExpandDims": Adds an additional dimension at a specific position, analogous to tf.expand_dims.
# - "CNTK.Squeeze": Removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of a tensor, similar to tf.squeeze.
```

This code provides a mapping and candidate APIs based on functional similarity between TensorFlow and CNTK, along with justifications for these mappings and selections.
