Here are five possible CNTK APIs that can be used for dropout:

1. `cntk.layers.Dropout`: This is a dropout layer that applies dropout to the input.
2. `cntk.ops.dropout`: This is a dropout operation that can be applied to any tensor.
3. `cntk.layers.DropoutWithScale`: This is a dropout layer that applies dropout with scaling to the input.
4. `cntk.ops.dropout_with_scale`: This is a dropout operation with scaling that can be applied to any tensor.
5. `cntk.layers.DropoutWithSpatial`: This is a dropout layer that applies dropout with spatial filtering to the input.
