CNTK does not have a direct equivalent to the `GRU` layer in TensorFlow. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `Recurrence` layer in CNTK. Here's an example of how to use the `Recurrence` layer to implement a GRU-like architecture:
```
import cntk as C

# Define the input and output shapes
input_shape = (None, 10)
output_shape = (None, 20)

# Create the Recurrence layer
gru = C.layers.Recurrence(C.layers.GRUCell(units=50), return_sequences=True)

# Define the model
model = C.models.Sequential()
model.add(gru)
model.add(C.layers.Dense(20, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
```
In this example, we define a `Recurrence` layer with a `GRUCell` and set `return_sequences=True` to return the output of each time step. We then add a `Dense` layer with 20 units and an activation function to convert the output to a probability distribution. Finally, we compile the model using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

Note that this is just one possible way to implement a GRU-like architecture in CNTK, and there may be other ways to achieve similar results depending on your specific use case.
