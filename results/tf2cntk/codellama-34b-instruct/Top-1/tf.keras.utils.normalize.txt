CNTK does not have a direct equivalent to `tensorflow.keras.utils.normalize`. However, you can use the following APIs in CNTK to achieve similar functionality:

* `cntk.ops.normalize`: This API normalizes the input data by scaling it to a common range, usually between 0 and 1.
* `cntk.ops.standardize`: This API standardizes the input data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature.

You can use these APIs in combination with other CNTK APIs to achieve similar functionality as `tensorflow.keras.utils.normalize`.
