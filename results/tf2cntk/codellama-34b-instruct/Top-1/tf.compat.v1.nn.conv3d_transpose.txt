CNTK does not have an exact equivalent of `tensorflow.compat.v1.nn.conv3d_transpose`. However, you can use the following CNTK APIs to achieve a similar result:

* `cntk.layers.ConvolutionTranspose3D`: This API performs a 3D transposed convolution operation on a 5D tensor (batch size, channels, depth, height, width). It is similar to the TensorFlow API in that it takes a filter and a stride as input, but it also requires the output shape of the transposed convolution.
* `cntk.layers.Deconvolution3D`: This API performs a 3D deconvolution operation on a 5D tensor (batch size, channels, depth, height, width). It is similar to the TensorFlow API in that it takes a filter and a stride as input, but it also requires the output shape of the deconvolution.

Both APIs have different parameters and usage compared to the TensorFlow API, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
