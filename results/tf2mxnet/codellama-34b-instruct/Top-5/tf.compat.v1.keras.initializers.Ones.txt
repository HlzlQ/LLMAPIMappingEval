Here are five possible MXNet APIs that can be used for initializing weights with ones:

1. `mxnet.initializers.Ones()`
2. `mxnet.init.ones()`
3. `mxnet.initializers.Constant(1)`
4. `mxnet.init.constant(1)`
5. `mxnet.initializers.Zeros(1)`

Note that the last one is not exactly the same as TensorFlow's `Ones`, but it can be used to initialize weights with ones by setting the `value` parameter to 1.
