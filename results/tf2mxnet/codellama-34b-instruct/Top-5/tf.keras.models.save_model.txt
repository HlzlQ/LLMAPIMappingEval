  tf.keras.models.save_model() is not directly available in MXNet. However, there are a few alternatives that can be used to save a model in MXNet:

1. mxnet.gluon.nn.Sequential.export(): This method allows you to export the model architecture and weights as a JSON file.
2. mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridBlock.save_parameters(): This method saves the model parameters in an MXNet-specific format.
3. mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridBlock.export(): This method allows you to export the model architecture and weights as a JSON file.
4. mxnet.ndarray.save(): This method allows you to save the model parameters as an MXNet-specific binary file.
5. mxnet.symbol.save(): This method allows you to save the model architecture as an MXNet-specific symbolic graph.
