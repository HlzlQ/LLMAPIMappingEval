Here are five possible MXNet APIs that can be used for padding:

1. `mxnet.ndarray.pad` - This API is similar to TensorFlow's `tf.pad`, and it allows you to pad a tensor with a specified value along a given axis.
2. `mxnet.ndarray.pad_constant` - This API is similar to TensorFlow's `tf.pad_constant`, and it allows you to pad a tensor with a constant value along a given axis.
3. `mxnet.ndarray.pad_reflect` - This API is similar to TensorFlow's `tf.pad_reflect`, and it allows you to pad a tensor by reflecting the values along a given axis.
4. `mxnet.ndarray.pad_symmetric` - This API is similar to TensorFlow's `tf.pad_symmetric`, and it allows you to pad a tensor by symmetrically padding the values along a given axis.
5. `mxnet.ndarray.pad_edge` - This API is similar to TensorFlow's `tf.pad_edge`, and it allows you to pad a tensor with the edge values along a given axis.
