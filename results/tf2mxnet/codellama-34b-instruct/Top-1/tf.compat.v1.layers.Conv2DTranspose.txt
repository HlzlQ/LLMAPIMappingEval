MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of TensorFlow's `Conv2DTranspose` API. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.ndarray.Convolution`: This is a low-level API that performs 2D convolution on a 4D input tensor. It takes the input tensor, filter weights, and bias as arguments and returns the output tensor.
* `mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2DTranspose`: This is a high-level API that provides a more convenient way to perform 2D transposed convolution. It takes the input tensor, filter weights, and bias as arguments and returns the output tensor.

Both of these APIs can be used to implement a transposed convolution layer in MXNet. However, `mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2DTranspose` is more convenient to use and provides additional features such as batch normalization and activation functions.
