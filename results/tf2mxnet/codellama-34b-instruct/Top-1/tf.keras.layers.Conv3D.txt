MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of TensorFlow's `Conv3D` layer. However, you can use the `mxnet.ndarray.convolution` module to perform 3D convolutions. Specifically, you can use the `convolve` function to perform a 3D convolution on a 5D tensor (batch size, channels, depth, height, width).

Here's an example of how you might implement a 3D convolution using MXNet:
```
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet.ndarray import convolve

# Define the input and filter tensors
input_tensor = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(1, 3, 5, 5, 5))
filter_tensor = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(3, 3, 3, 3, 3))

# Perform the convolution
output_tensor = convolve(input_tensor, filter_tensor)
```
Note that this is just one possible way to implement a 3D convolution using MXNet. There may be other ways to do it as well.
