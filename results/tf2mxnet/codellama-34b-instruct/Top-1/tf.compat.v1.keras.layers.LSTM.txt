MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of the `LSTMPlease` layer from TensorFlow's Keras API. However, MXNet provides a similar functionality through its `RNN` module.

Here is an example of how to implement an LSTM network in MXNet using the `RNN` module:
```
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import ndarray as nd

# Define the input and output shapes
input_shape = (10, 5)
output_shape = (10, 3)

# Create a simple LSTM network with one layer
model = mx.gluon.nn.Sequential()
with model.name_scope():
    model.add(mx.gluon.rnn.LSTMCell(input_size=5, hidden_size=3))

# Initialize the parameters and move them to the GPU (if available)
model.collect_params().initialize()
model.hybridize()

# Create a dummy input and output
inputs = nd.random.normal(shape=input_shape)
outputs = nd.random.normal(shape=output_shape)

# Forward pass
outputs = model(inputs)
```
In this example, we define an LSTM network with one layer using the `LSTMCell` class from MXNet's `rnn` module. We then initialize the parameters and move them to the GPU (if available). Finally, we create a dummy input and output and perform a forward pass through the network using the `model` object.

Note that this is just one example of how to implement an LSTM network in MXNet, and there are many other ways to do it. The key point is that MXNet provides a flexible and powerful API for building and training RNNs, including LSTMs.
