MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.MaxPooling3D`. However, you can use the `mxnet.ndarray.max_pooling` function to perform 3D max pooling on a tensor. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Create a random 5D tensor
data = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Perform 3D max pooling with a window size of (2, 2, 2) and stride of (1, 1, 1)
pool = mx.ndarray.max_pooling(data, kernel_size=(2, 2, 2), strides=(1, 1, 1))
```
