MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.compat.v1.distributions.Gamma` API. However, MXNet provides a similar distribution class called `mxnet.ndarray.random.gamma`. The `gamma` function in MXNet takes the same arguments as the `Gamma` distribution in TensorFlow, including `shape`, `scale`, and `seed`.

Therefore, to map the TensorFlow API to MXNet, you can use the following code:
```python
import mxnet.ndarray.random as random

# TensorFlow API
tf_gamma = tf.compat.v1.distributions.Gamma(shape=shape, scale=scale, seed=seed)

# MXNet API
mx_gamma = random.gamma(shape=shape, scale=scale, seed=seed)
```
