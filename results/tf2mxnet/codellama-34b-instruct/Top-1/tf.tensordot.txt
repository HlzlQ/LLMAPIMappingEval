MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of TensorFlow's `tensordot` function. However, you can achieve a similar result using the `mxnet.ndarray.dot` function.

Here is an example of how to use `mxnet.ndarray.dot` to perform a tensor dot product in MXNet:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create two tensors
a = mx.nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = mx.nd.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Perform tensor dot product
c = mx.nd.dot(a, b)

print(c)
```
This will output the following tensor:
```
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]
```
Note that the `mxnet.ndarray.dot` function performs a matrix multiplication between two tensors, and returns a new tensor with the result. In this example, we are performing a dot product between two 2D tensors, but you can also perform dot products between higher-dimensional tensors by specifying the appropriate axes.
