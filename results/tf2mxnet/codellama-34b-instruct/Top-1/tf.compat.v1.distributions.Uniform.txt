MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of TensorFlow's `Uniform` distribution class. However, you can use the `mxnet.ndarray.random.uniform` function to generate random values from a uniform distribution. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Generate 10 random values from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1
values = mx.ndarray.random.uniform(low=0, high=1, size=(10))
print(values)
```
This will output an array of 10 random values between 0 and 1. You can adjust the `low` and `high` parameters to change the range of the distribution.
