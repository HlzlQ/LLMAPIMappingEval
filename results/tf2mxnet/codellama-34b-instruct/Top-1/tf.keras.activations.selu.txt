MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of the `selu` activation function from TensorFlow. However, you can use the `leaky_relu` activation function with a negative slope to achieve similar results. The `leaky_relu` function is defined as:

f(x) = max(alpha \* x, x)

where alpha is a hyperparameter that controls the slope of the negative part of the function. A common value for alpha is 0.1 or 0.2.

So, to use `leaky_relu` in MXNet, you can do:
```
from mxnet import ndarray as nd

# Define a symbolic variable
x = nd.Variable('x')

# Apply the leaky_relu activation function with alpha=0.1
y = nd.leaky_relu(x, alpha=0.1)
```
