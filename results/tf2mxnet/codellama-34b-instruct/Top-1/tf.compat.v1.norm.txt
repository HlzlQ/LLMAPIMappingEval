MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of `tensorflow.compat.v1.norm`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.ndarray.Norm`: This API calculates the norm of a tensor along a specified axis.
* `mxnet.ndarray.LpNorm`: This API calculates the Lp-norm of a tensor along a specified axis.

For example, to calculate the 2-norm of a tensor `x` along the last axis, you can use:
```
import mxnet as mx

x = mx.ndarray([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
mx.ndarray.Norm(x, axis=-1)
```
This will return a tensor with shape `(2,)` and values `[3, 5]`.
