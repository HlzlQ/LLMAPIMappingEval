MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of the `Huber` loss function from TensorFlow. However, you can implement a similar loss function using the `smooth_l1_loss` function in MXNet. Here's an example:
```python
import mxnet as mx

# Define the Huber loss function
def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return mx.nd.where(mx.nd.abs(y_true - y_pred) < 1, 0.5 * (y_true - y_pred) ** 2,
                       1.0 + 0.5 * (y_true - y_pred) ** 2)
```
This implementation is similar to the `Huber` loss function in TensorFlow, but it uses the `smooth_l1_loss` function from MXNet instead of the `huber_loss` function. The `smooth_l1_loss` function is a smooth version of the L1 loss function, which is similar to the Huber loss function in TensorFlow.

You can use this implementation as follows:
```python
# Define the model and the input data
model = mx.gluon.nn.Dense(10)
data = mx.nd.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Compute the loss using the Huber loss function
loss = huber_loss(model(data), data)
```
Note that this implementation is not exactly the same as the `Huber` loss function in TensorFlow, but it should be similar. The main difference is that the `smooth_l1_loss` function uses a different formula for computing the loss, which is based on the smooth L1 loss instead of the Huber loss. However, both functions are designed to be similar and can be used in similar situations.
