MXNet does not have an exact equivalent to TensorFlow's `RNNCell` class. However, MXNet provides a similar functionality through its `rnn` module. The `rnn` module in MXNet provides a set of classes and functions for building and training recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

The most likely equivalent to TensorFlow's `RNNCell` class in MXNet is the `mxnet.rnn.RNNCell` class. This class provides a similar interface for defining an RNN cell, including methods for initializing the cell state and computing the output of the cell given the input and previous state.

Here's an example of how to define an RNN cell in MXNet using the `mxnet.rnn.RNNCell` class:
```
import mxnet as mx

cell = mx.rnn.RNNCell(num_hidden=128, activation='tanh')
```
This code defines an RNN cell with 128 hidden units and a tanh activation function. The `num_hidden` argument specifies the number of hidden units in the cell, and the `activation` argument specifies the activation function to use for the hidden units.

You can then use this cell to build an RNN model using MXNet's `rnn` module. For example:
```
import mxnet as mx

cell = mx.rnn.RNNCell(num_hidden=128, activation='tanh')
model = mx.rnn.SequentialRNNCell([cell])
```
This code defines an RNN model with a single layer of 128 hidden units and a tanh activation function. The `SequentialRNNCell` class is used to define the sequence of cells in the model, and the `cell` variable is passed as a list of cells to the constructor.

Overall, while MXNet does not have an exact equivalent to TensorFlow's `RNNCell` class, the `mxnet.rnn.RNNCell` class provides similar functionality for defining RNN cells in MXNet.
