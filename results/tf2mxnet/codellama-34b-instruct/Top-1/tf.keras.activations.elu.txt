MXNet does not have a direct equivalent of TensorFlow's `elu` activation function. However, you can achieve similar results using the `leaky_relu` activation function in MXNet with a negative slope parameter.

Here is an example:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Define a LeakyReLU activation function with a negative slope of 0.5
act = mx.gluon.nn.LeakyReLU(alpha=0.5)

# Use the activation function to transform an input tensor
input_tensor = mx.nd.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
output_tensor = act(input_tensor)
```
In this example, the `LeakyReLU` activation function is defined with a negative slope of 0.5, which means that the output will be scaled down by a factor of 0.5 for negative input values. The `act` function can then be used to transform an input tensor using this activation function.
