MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of TensorFlow's `depth_to_space` function. However, you can achieve a similar result using the `mxnet.ndarray.reshape` and `mxnet.ndarray.transpose` functions.

Here is an example of how to reshape and transpose a tensor in MXNet to achieve a similar effect as TensorFlow's `depth_to_space`:
```
import mxnet as mx

# Create a sample tensor with shape (1, 2, 3, 4)
data = mx.nd.array([[[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]])

# Reshape the tensor to (1, 2, 3, 2)
data = mx.nd.reshape(data, (1, 2, 3, 2))

# Transpose the tensor to (1, 2, 2, 3)
data = mx.nd.transpose(data, (0, 1, 3, 2))
```
Note that the resulting tensor will have a different shape than the original tensor, but it should be equivalent in terms of the data it contains.
