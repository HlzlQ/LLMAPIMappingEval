MXNet does not have an exact equivalent of `tensorflow.keras.utils.normalize`. However, you can use the following APIs to achieve similar functionality:

* `mxnet.ndarray.Norm`: This API calculates the norm of a tensor. You can use it to calculate the L1 or L2 norm of a tensor.
* `mxnet.ndarray.Normalize`: This API normalizes a tensor by dividing it by its maximum value. It is similar to `tensorflow.keras.utils.normalize`.

Here's an example of how you can use these APIs:
```scss
import mxnet as mx

# Calculate the L1 norm of a tensor
tensor = mx.ndarray([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
norm = mx.ndarray.Norm(tensor, ord=1)
print(norm) # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

# Normalize a tensor by dividing it by its maximum value
tensor = mx.ndarray([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
normalized_tensor = mx.ndarray.Normalize(tensor)
print(normalized_tensor) # Output: [[0.5, 1], [1.5, 2]]
```
