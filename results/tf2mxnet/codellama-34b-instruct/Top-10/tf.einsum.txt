  tf.einsum is a TensorFlow API for performing einsum operations on tensors. The equivalent API in MXNet is called `mxnet.ndarray.einsum`. Here are ten APIs that you might find useful:

1. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum` - This is the main einsum API in MXNet, which performs einsum operations on tensors.
2. `mxnet.ndarray.dot` - This API performs dot product operations on tensors.
3. `mxnet.ndarray.matmul` - This API performs matrix multiplication operations on tensors.
4. `mxnet.ndarray.tensordot` - This API performs tensor contraction operations on tensors.
5. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_path` - This API returns the optimal contraction path for einsum operations.
6. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_contract` - This API performs einsum operations using the specified contraction path.
7. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_optimize` - This API optimizes the contraction order of einsum operations.
8. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_fuse` - This API fuses multiple einsum operations into a single operation.
9. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_split` - This API splits a large einsum operation into smaller sub-operations.
10. `mxnet.ndarray.einsum_parallel` - This API performs einsum operations in parallel using multiple GPUs or CPU cores.
