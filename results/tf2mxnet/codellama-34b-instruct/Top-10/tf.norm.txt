Here are ten MXNet APIs that have similar functionality to the TensorFlow API:

1. `mxnet.ndarray` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.Tensor`. It represents a multi-dimensional array of numerical values.
2. `mxnet.symbolic_expression` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.SymbolicExpression`. It represents a symbolic expression that can be evaluated to produce a value.
3. `mxnet.autograd` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape`. It provides automatic differentiation for computing gradients.
4. `mxnet.optimizer` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.Optimizer`. It provides a set of optimization algorithms for training models.
5. `mxnet.loss_function` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.LossFunction`. It provides a set of loss functions that can be used to train models.
6. `mxnet.metrics` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.Metric`. It provides a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate model performance.
7. `mxnet.data_loader` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset`. It provides a way to load and preprocess data for training models.
8. `mxnet.model` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.keras.Model`. It provides a way to define and train machine learning models.
9. `mxnet.callbacks` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.keras.callbacks`. It provides a set of callback functions that can be used during training to perform various tasks such as logging, checkpointing, and early stopping.
10. `mxnet.utils` - This is the equivalent of TensorFlow's `tf.utils`. It provides a set of utility functions for working with MXNet models and data.
