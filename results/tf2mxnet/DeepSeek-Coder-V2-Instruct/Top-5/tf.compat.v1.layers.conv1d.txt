## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the equivalent MXNet layers for the given TensorFlow layer, we need to look at the functionalities provided by both frameworks and map them accordingly. The task is to identify five MXNet APIs that closely match the functionality of `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.conv1d`.

### Step 1: Understand the Functionality of `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.conv1d`
- **Description**: This API performs a 1D convolution over an input tensor, which is typically a 3D tensor where the first dimension represents batch size, the second dimension represents sequence length, and the third dimension represents the number of input channels (or depth).
- **Parameters**:
  - `inputs`: A 3D tensor with shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, num_input_channels]`.
  - `filters`: An integer or a list/tuple specifying the number of filters in the convolution.
  - `kernel_size`: An integer or tuple/list specifying the height and width of the 2D convolution window.
  - `strides`: An integer or tuple/list specifying the strides of the convolution along the sequence length dimension.
  - `padding`: A string from: `"valid"` (no padding), `"same"` (output has the same size as input with some reflection padding if necessary).
  - Other optional parameters include activation, use_bias, kernel_initializer, bias_initializer, etc.

### Step 2: Identify MXNet APIs that Match the Functionality
- **mx.nd.Convolution**: This is a general convolution API in MXNet for both 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutions. It can be used to perform 1D convolution by specifying the appropriate number of dimensions.
- **mx.nd.Conv1D**: A specialized API specifically for 1D convolution.
- **mx.gluon.nn.Conv1D**: This is a layer in Gluon (MXNet's deep learning library) designed to perform 1D convolutions, similar to TensorFlow's `conv1d`.
- **mx.nd.DepthwiseConvolution**: This can be used for depthwise separable convolution which includes 1D operations as well.
- **mx.gluon.nn.Conv2D**: While this is not directly a 1D convolution API, it can perform similar tasks if the input shape is manipulated to fit into 2D convolutions (e.g., treating sequence length as width in a 2D space).

### Step 3: Select the Most Likely APIs
Based on the functionalities and typical use cases, the most likely MXNet APIs that match `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.conv1d` are:
1. **mx.nd.Convolution** (or its alias for convolution operations)
2. **mx.nd.Conv1D**
3. **mx.gluon.nn.Conv1D**
4. **mx.nd.DepthwiseConvolution** (if applicable in the context of 1D convolutions)
5. **mx.gluon.nn.Conv2D** (as a fallback for more complex scenarios where input shape manipulation is necessary)

### Final Answer:
The names of the five most likely MXNet APIs are:
1. mx.nd.Convolution
2. mx.nd.Conv1D
3. mx.gluon.nn.Conv1D
4. mx.nd.DepthwiseConvolution
5. mx.gluon.nn.Conv2D
