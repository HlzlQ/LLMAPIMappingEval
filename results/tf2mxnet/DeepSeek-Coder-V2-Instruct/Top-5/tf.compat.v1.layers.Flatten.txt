## Solution

The equivalent MXNet layers for the given TensorFlow layer `tensorflow.compat.v1.layers.Flatten` can be found by looking at the documentation for MXNet's neural network layers. Here are five MXNet APIs that perform similar functions:

1. **mxnet.symbol.flatten** - This API flattens the input array into a 2D array (a batch of vectors).
2. **mxnet.symbol.reshape** - Allows reshaping of arrays, which can be used to flatten an array by setting its new shape to `(batch_size, -1)`.
3. **mxnet.symbol.transpose** - Can be used to change the dimensions of an array for flattening purposes.
4. **mxnet.symbol.stack** - Combines a list of arrays along a new axis. This can be useful if you need to stack multiple flattened arrays together.
5. **mxnet.symbol.contrib.reshape_like** - Allows reshaping one tensor to the shape of another tensor, which can be used for flattening in certain contexts.

These APIs provide similar functionality to TensorFlow's `Flatten` layer by either directly or indirectly reducing the dimensionality of the input array to a 1D vector suitable for feeding into dense layers.
