## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the equivalent MXNet function for each part of the TensorFlow `conv2d` API, we need to understand what each part does in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The `conv2d` function is used to apply a 2D convolution over an input tensor. Here are the key components and their functions:

1. **Input**: The tensor from which the convolution operation will be applied.
2. **Filter/Kernel**: A set of learnable weights that represent the convolutional filter.
3. **Strides**: The number of pixels to slide over the input for each step of the convolution.
4. **Padding**: Determines how the input is padded with zeros around its borders before applying the convolution.
5. **Data Format**: Specifies the format of the input tensor, including whether the channel dimension is at the end or beginning.
6. **Dilations**: Spacing between kernel elements (in other words, the space "between" entries in the filter).

Given these components, we can map TensorFlow's `conv2d` to MXNet's equivalent functions:

1. **Input**: The input tensor is directly used as the first argument in MXNet.
2. **Filter/Kernel**: This corresponds to the weight parameter in MXNet.
3. **Strides**: This can be set using the `strides` parameter in MXNet, which specifies the strides for each dimension of the convolution window.
4. **Padding**: This is handled by specifying padding sizes directly in MXNet.
5. **Data Format**: While TensorFlow and MXNet have different default formats (NHWC vs NCHW), this can be adjusted using parameters in both frameworks.
6. **Dilations**: This parameter does not exist in the current version of MXNet's convolution functions, but could potentially be added if needed for future versions or through custom layers.

Based on these mappings and considering common convolutional neural network operations, here are five most likely equivalent MXNet APIs:

1. `mxnet.ndarray.Convolution` - This is the base function for 2D convolutions in MXNet.
2. `mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2D` - A high-level API that provides more flexibility and integrates well with other Gluon layers.
3. `mxnet.symbol.Convolution` - Used for creating symbolic graphs, which is useful for model definition but not directly equivalent to TensorFlow's eager execution style.
4. `mxnet.ndarray.Correlation` - Although primarily used for correlation operations, it shares some similarities in the application of filters and could be adapted for convolutions.
5. `mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2DTranspose` - While not a direct convolution operation, this is useful for deconvolutional layers which can perform upsampling after a convolutional layer.

These mappings are based on common usage patterns in deep learning frameworks and the functional similarities between TensorFlow's `conv2d` and MXNet's convolution operations.
