## Step-by-Step Solution:

To find the equivalent MXNet function for the given TensorFlow API `tensorflow.compat.v1.depth_to_space`, we need to look for a similar functionality in MXNet that can perform spatial rearrangement of depth slices. Here are five likely candidates based on common functions and their purposes:

1. **`mxnet.ndarray.reshape`**: This function allows reshaping of arrays, which could be used to rearrange the dimensions as needed by `depth_to_space`.
2. **`mxnet.ndarray.transpose`**: If the input needs to be transposed before or after reshaping, this function can help with that.
3. **`mxnet.ndarray.split`**: This could be used if the depth slices need to be split and rearranged spatially.
4. **`mxnet.ndarray.concat`**: If multiple arrays need to be concatenated in a specific order after spatial rearrangement, this function might be useful.
5. **`mxnet.ndarray.batch_norm`**: While not directly related to the depth-to-space operation, it is worth noting that batch normalization can affect how data is processed and reshaped internally within layers of a neural network.

These functions cover potential aspects of array manipulation or processing that could be analogous to what `depth_to_space` does in TensorFlow.
