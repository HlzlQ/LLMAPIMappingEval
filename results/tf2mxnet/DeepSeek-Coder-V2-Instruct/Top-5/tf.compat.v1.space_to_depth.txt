## Step-by-step solution:

To find the equivalent MXNet function for the given TensorFlow API `tensorflow.compat.v1.space_to_depth`, we need to identify a similar functionality in MXNet that can perform a space-to-depth transformation on an input tensor. Here are five likely candidates based on common transformations and reshaping operations available in MXNet:

1. **`mxnet.ndarray.reshape`**: This function allows for changing the shape of the array, which could be used to rearrange dimensions as needed for space-to-depth transformation.
2. **`mxnet.ndarray.transpose`**: If the input tensor needs to be transposed before reshaping, this function can adjust the axes accordingly.
3. **`mxnet.ndarray.split`**: This could be used if the data needs to be split and rearranged in a specific pattern for space-to-depth transformation.
4. **`mxnet.ndarray.stack`**: If multiple tensors need to be combined in a way that achieves a space-to-depth effect, this function might be useful.
5. **`mxnet.ndarray.concat`**: Similar to `stack`, but concatenates along a specified axis rather than stacking them. This could also be used if the data needs to be rearranged and concatenated in specific ways for space-to-depth transformation.

These functions cover various aspects of tensor manipulation that might be needed to replicate or approximate the functionality of `tensorflow.compat.v1.space_to_depth`.
