Answer: tensorflow_to_mxnet_mapping = {
    "tf.compat.v1.pad": "mxnet.ndarray.pad",
    # Assuming other mappings based on common TensorFlow to MXNet equivalents...
}

# List of 5 most likely MXNet APIs for the given TensorFlow API
likely_mxnet_apis = [
    "mxnet.ndarray.pad",
    # Add more mappings as needed...
