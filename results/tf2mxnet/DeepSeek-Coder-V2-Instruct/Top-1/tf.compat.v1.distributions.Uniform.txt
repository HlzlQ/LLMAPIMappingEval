MXNet Uniform
```

### Explanation:
The `tensorflow.compat.v1.distributions.Uniform` API provides functionality for creating uniform distributions in TensorFlow. To find a corresponding MXNet API with similar functionalities, we need to look for an equivalent distribution class in MXNet that can handle the same operations and parameters as the TensorFlow Uniform distribution.

In MXNet, the most likely counterpart to `tensorflow.compat.v1.distributions.Uniform` is the `mxnet.gluon.distribution.Uniform` class, which provides similar functionality for creating uniform distributions.
