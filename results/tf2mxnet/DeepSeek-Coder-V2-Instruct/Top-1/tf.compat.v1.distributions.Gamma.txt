MXNet Gamma
```

### Explanation:
The `tf.compat.v1.distributions.Gamma` function in TensorFlow is used to create a gamma distribution object. In MXNet, there isn't an exact equivalent of this specific TensorFlow function, but you can achieve similar functionality using the `mxnet.gluon.distribution.Gamma` class from MXNet Gluon.

Therefore, the most likely API in MXNet that corresponds to `tf.compat.v1.distributions.Gamma` is `mxnet.gluon.distribution.Gamma`.
